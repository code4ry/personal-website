    <p class="descriptions"> 
      In this lab, I created my development environment. I created my virtual machine in Microsoft Azure,
      then I created my GitHub repository for all my labs, work, and even this website. Then, after successfully 
      creating my development environment, I was ready to start coding!

      In this lab, I was tasked with recreating my exact resume in an HTML/CSS file. The goal of
      this lab was to get comfortable coding in HTML/CSS and also getting familiar with Github, 
      Microsoft Azure, and Chrome Developer Tools. This lab was really beneficial in fine tuning my
      HTML and CSS skills and has prepared me for future labs.<br>Click on the image to see more!

      This lab was a really simple yet creative and fun one to complete because I got to make my own personal website.
      This website will have a homepage, an about me page, and even a projects page that will keep getting updated as
      more projects are completed and posted here. Click on the image to check out my website!

      This lab isn't complete yet. Hang in there as it will be here very soon!

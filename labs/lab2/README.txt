Lab 2: Resume

## DESCRIPTION

The resume file contain the HTML markup of the contents of my resume in addition to the CSS that was embedded within the
same file that style my resume. 

## COMMENTS

When validating my resume file through the W3 validator, I ran into three errors. All three of them were the same error, 
because I didn't know that you can't have <ul> as the child of another <ul>. So all I had to do was remove the <ul> block
from all the other <ul> blocks it was inside of and place it beneath. Otherwise, the markup was valid. Overall, this lab wasn't too
difficult to complete and it is nice practice for getting used to coding in HTML/CSS.

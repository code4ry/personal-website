# Ryan Lee's Personal Website

Description:
    I designed and created my own personal website. It was very simple yet creative where I referenced the 
    website architecture designed I created to make the homepage, the projects page, and the CSS file that styles both 
    pages. This made it very easy to understand and navigate this lab and made it very fun to complete. My homepage contains
    tabs to my Projects page, my About Me portion of my home page, and the Contact Me portion of my home page. Then, it has my About
    Me and Contact Me information. For my Projects page, it contains the same tabs from my home page and displays the labs I've completed.
